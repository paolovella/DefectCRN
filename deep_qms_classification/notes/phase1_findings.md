# Phase 1 Findings: δ_cen vs δ_struct

## Key Discovery

**Theorem (Empirical):** δ_cen ≥ δ_struct always.

More precisely: dim(Z(A_int)) ≥ dim(C(S*(G)))

## Explanation

The structural commutant C(S*(G)) is based on the **support** (nonzero pattern) of the
generators H and L_k. It's the set of matrices commuting with all matrix units E_ij
where there's a nonzero entry.

The interaction center Z(A_int) is the center of the **algebra** generated by H and L_k.

The inequality δ_cen ≥ δ_struct arises because:

1. The test set S*(G) is derived from the support of generators
2. An abelian algebra can have "full support" (all entries nonzero)
3. When A_int is abelian, Z(A_int) = A_int, which may be larger than C(S*(G))

## Examples Where δ_cen > δ_struct

### Example 1: Coherent Only with σx

```
H = σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
L = (none)

A_int = span{I, σx} = 2-dimensional abelian algebra
Z(A_int) = A_int (since abelian), dim = 2
δ_cen = 1

Graph: coherent edges (0,1) and (1,0)
Test set: {E_01, E_10}
C(S*(G)) = scalar matrices, dim = 1
δ_struct = 0

Gap: δ_cen - δ_struct = 1
```

### Example 2: Off-diagonal Jump L = σx

```
H = 0
L = σx

A_int = Alg*(σx) = span{I, σx} (σx² = I)
Same as above: δ_cen = 1, δ_struct = 0
```

### Example 3: Projective Jump L = |+⟩⟨+|

```
H = 0
L = |+⟩⟨+| where |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2

L = [[1/2, 1/2], [1/2, 1/2]]
L has all entries nonzero → full test set

A_int = span{I, L} (L is rank-1 idempotent, L² = L/2)
A_int is abelian, Z(A_int) = A_int, dim = 2
δ_cen = 1

C(S*(G)) = scalars (commute with all E_ij), dim = 1
δ_struct = 0
```

## Interpretation

The structural deficiency δ_struct is a **lower bound** for the central deficiency δ_cen.

- δ_struct captures the graph structure (connectivity)
- δ_cen captures the algebraic structure (block decomposition of A_int)

When A_int is abelian but has "full support", we get δ_cen > δ_struct.

## Cases Where δ_cen = δ_struct

In all tested cases where A_int = M_n(ℂ) (full matrix algebra):
- δ_cen = 0 (center = scalars)
- δ_struct = 0 (graph is strongly connected)
- Equality holds

In pure dephasing (diagonal generators):
- δ_cen = n-1 (A_int = diagonal matrices, center = A_int)
- δ_struct = n-1 (test set = diagonal matrix units, commutant = diagonals)
- Equality holds

## Conjecture

**Conjecture:** δ_cen = δ_struct iff the interaction algebra A_int equals the
algebra generated by the test set as a *-algebra.

Equivalently: the gap δ_cen - δ_struct measures how much "smaller" A_int is
compared to what the graph structure suggests.

## Next Steps

1. Prove the inequality δ_cen ≥ δ_struct formally in Lean
2. Characterize exactly when equality holds
3. Understand the relationship to quantum deficiency δ_Q
