# Classical Reduction Theorem

## Statement

For a classical Markov chain with rate matrix Q embedded as a QMS:
- H = 0 (no coherent dynamics)
- L_{ij} = √q_{ij} |j⟩⟨i| for each transition i → j with q_{ij} > 0

We have:
```
δ_cen = δ_Q = ℓ - 1
```
where ℓ is the number of connected components (linkage classes).

## Verification

## Why It Works

For embedded Markov chains:

1. **Graph structure**: Jump operators L_{ij} have support E_{ji}, so the
   interaction algebra A_int is generated by matrix units E_{ji} for all
   transitions i → j.

2. **Block structure**: The algebra decomposes into blocks corresponding to
   connected components. Each component C gives a full matrix algebra M_{|C|}(ℂ).

3. **Center**: Z(A_int) = ⊕_α ℂ·I_{|C_α|} where the sum is over connected
   components. So dim Z(A_int) = ℓ.

4. **Deficiency**: δ_cen = dim Z(A_int) - 1 = ℓ - 1.

## Relation to CRN Deficiency

In Chemical Reaction Network theory, the deficiency is:
```
δ = n - ℓ - rank(S)
```
where:
- n = number of complexes
- ℓ = number of linkage classes
- S = stoichiometric matrix

For a Markov chain (no stoichiometry, single molecule):
- Each state is a "complex"
- n = number of states
- rank(S) = 0 (no conserved quantities beyond probability)

So the classical CRN deficiency simplifies to:
```
δ = n - ℓ - 0 = n - ℓ
```

But our quantum deficiency is δ_Q = ℓ - 1, not n - ℓ.

**Resolution**: Different conventions! In QMS theory:
- δ_Q = dim(stationary space) - 1
- Each component has a unique stationary distribution
- So dim(stationary) = ℓ, giving δ_Q = ℓ - 1

The classical CRN deficiency counts "degrees of freedom" differently.

## Quantum Generalization

For general QMS (not just embedded Markov chains):
- δ_cen counts the number of "algebraic blocks" in A_int
- δ_Q counts the number of stationary states
- The theorem δ_Q = δ_cen connects dynamics to algebra

Quantum effects can create additional structure:
- Coherent superpositions (off-diagonal stationary states)
- Non-commutative block structure
- Oscillatory dynamics (peripheral spectrum)

But the fundamental relationship δ_Q = δ_cen persists.
