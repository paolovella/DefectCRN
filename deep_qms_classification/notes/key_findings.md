# Key Findings: QMS Classification Invariants

## Summary of Computational Experiments

We computed the following invariants across 20+ test cases:
- δ_cen: Central deficiency = dim Z(A_int) - 1
- δ_struct: Structural deficiency = dim C(S*(G)) - 1
- δ_Q: Quantum deficiency = dim ker(L) - 1

## Main Theorems (Empirically Verified)

### Theorem 1: δ_cen ≥ δ_struct (Inequality)

The central deficiency is always at least as large as the structural deficiency.

**Proof sketch:**
- The test set S*(G) captures only the support (nonzero pattern)
- The interaction algebra A_int is generated by the actual operators
- When A_int is abelian (like span{I, σ_x}), Z(A_int) = A_int can be larger
  than C(S*(G)) even when the support is "full"

**Gap examples:**
- H = σ_x, no jumps: δ_cen = 1, δ_struct = 0
- H = 0, L = σ_x: δ_cen = 1, δ_struct = 0
- H = 0, L = |+⟩⟨+|: δ_cen = 1, δ_struct = 0

### Theorem 2: δ_Q = δ_cen (Equality)

The quantum deficiency always equals the central deficiency!

**Verified in all test cases:**
| Example              | δ_Q | δ_cen | Equal |
|----------------------|-----|-------|-------|
| Amplitude Damping    | 0   | 0     | ✓     |
| Pure Dephasing (3L)  | 2   | 2     | ✓     |
| Two Blocks (4L)      | 1   | 1     | ✓     |
| Coherent Only (σ_x)  | 1   | 1     | ✓     |
| Three-Cycle          | 0   | 0     | ✓     |

**Significance:**
This connects dynamical information (ker L = stationary states) to
algebraic information (center of interaction algebra).

**Relation to Evans-Høegh-Krohn:**
Under faithful stationary state, EHK gives dim(A_int') = dim(ker L).
Since Z(A_int) ⊆ A_int' with equality for simple algebras, we get
dim Z(A_int) = dim(ker L) under appropriate conditions.

### Theorem 3: rank(L) = n² - δ_Q - 1

This is just rank-nullity: rank(L) + dim(ker L) = n²
So rank(L) = n² - (δ_Q + 1) = n² - δ_Q - 1.

Not a classification invariant per se, but confirms consistency.

## Invariant Hierarchy

```
δ_struct ≤ δ_cen = δ_Q
```

This suggests:
1. δ_struct is a lower bound (from graph structure alone)
2. δ_cen = δ_Q is the true invariant (from algebra/dynamics)
3. The gap δ_cen - δ_struct measures how "abelian" A_int is compared to its support

## Wedderburn Type

For A_int ≅ ⊕_α M_{d_α} ⊗ I_{m_α}:

- dim A_int = Σ_α d_α² m_α²
- dim Z(A_int) = number of blocks = Σ_α 1 = |α|
- dim A_int' = Σ_α m_α²

Examples:
- M_n(ℂ): dim = n², dim Z = 1, type = (n, 1)
- Diagonals (ℂ^n): dim = n, dim Z = n, type = n × (1, 1)
- M_2 ⊕ M_2: dim = 8, dim Z = 2, type = [(2,1), (2,1)]

## Candidate Classification

**Conjecture:** Two Lindbladians L₁, L₂ are equivalent iff:
1. Type(L₁) = Type(L₂) (Wedderburn signature)
2. δ_cen(L₁) = δ_cen(L₂) (equivalently: number of blocks match)
3. Phase(L₁) ≅ Phase(L₂) (peripheral spectrum group structure)

The rank term seems to be absorbed into the Wedderburn type, since
dim A_int determines the type once we know the center dimension.

## Open Questions

1. **Prove δ_Q = δ_cen formally** in Lean using Evans-Høegh-Krohn

2. **Characterize the gap δ_cen - δ_struct**:
   - When exactly is it nonzero?
   - Conjecture: nonzero iff A_int is abelian but has "full support"

3. **Phase group structure**:
   - Is it always finite?
   - How does it relate to symmetries of the Lindbladian?

4. **Classical reduction**:
   - For embedded Markov chains, verify δ_cen = ℓ - 1 (linkage classes)
   - Show how classical deficiency formula emerges

## Next Steps

1. Formalize the inequality δ_cen ≥ δ_struct in Lean
2. Prove δ_Q = δ_cen using EHK theorem (needs faithful state hypothesis)
3. Build examples that distinguish different Wedderburn types
4. Complete the classical reduction theorem
