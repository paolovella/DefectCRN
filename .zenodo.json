  "title": "DefectCRN: Formal Verification of Chemical Reaction Network Theory and Quantum Markov Semigroups",
  "description": "A formally verified Lean 4 library for Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) and Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMS). Implements the Onsager-Rayleigh variational framework, Feinberg-Horn-Jackson deficiency theorems, and quantum extensions including the universal classification theorem. Zero sorries, 22 axioms, 16,042 lines, 590 theorems.",
